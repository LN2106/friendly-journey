leveraging machine learning and deep learning for churn analysis.
Hello!!! This is our Final Year Project where we have tried to make a churn prediction model using the best of our abilities and skills.

There are several files the file EDA_telecom_customer_fFYP.ipynb contain the Exploratory data analysis with visualization while the file FEATURE_ENGINEERING.ipynb contains the pre processed data where we have encoded and scaled the data along with several pre processing steps

Then there is ML_MODEL.ipynb file where we have implemented 5 machine learning models  and have achieved an accuracy of 82% and have also tried to resample Data
